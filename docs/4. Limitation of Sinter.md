# Limitation of Sinter

The most critical issue of Sinter was the inability to stop a program from running. The following is our approach to add the ability to stop the program.

This issue has been resolved in June 2023.

## Adding `sinter_stop` to `Sinter` library

There was an unused `isRunning` variable in the `sistate` struct, located in `main.c`. Toggling this value and checking it in the `main_loop` located in `vm.c` can stop the execution of Sinter.

Hence, the following changes are made:

1. Add the following condition in `main_loop` at `vm.c`

    ```c
    if (!sistate.running) {
        SIDEBUG("The program has been stopped by the user.\n");
        sifault(sinter_fault_stopped);
        return;
      }
    ```

2. Add this method in `vm.c`

    ```c
    void sistop() {
      sistate.running = false;
      sistate.fault_reason = sinter_fault_stopped;
      sistate.pc = NULL;
      sistate.program = NULL;
      sistate.program_end = NULL;
      sistate.env = NULL;
    }
    ```

3. Where `sinter_fault_stopped` is a new `fault_reason` added in `sinter.h`

    ```c
    typedef enum {
      ...
      sinter_fault_stopped = 13
    } sinter_fault_t;
    ```

4. Finally, wrap `sistop()` in `main.c` and expose it in `sinter.h`

    ```c
    // main.c
    void sinter_stop() {
      sistop();
    }
    ```

    ```c
    // sinter.h
    void sinter_stop();
    ```


## Result

A program running on Sinter can now be stopped using `sinter_stop` method. The program will return a **fault value of 13** and **return type of 0**.

```bash
//sample output
Program exited with fault 13 and result type 0 (0, 0, 0.00, )
```
